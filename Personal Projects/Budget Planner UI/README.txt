About:

This application allows the user to create budgets through a user interface. During budget creation, 
the user goes through multiple pages prompting for information like income and expenses. Expenses 
consist of different information including priority, that is set using drag and drop. All entered 
information is displayed through list views and individual month and expense cells are editable.

Process:

I am creating this application using JavaFX, Java, FXML, and CSS. I am heavily using the MVC design 
pattern for user interface aspects of this project. Java and JavaFX are used for the controller and 
model while FXML and CSS are being used for the view. The Observer pattern is used for changes made 
to different aspects of the overall budget. The Factory pattern is used to create different display 
cells, like expenses and months.

I am practicing Agile principles by using Trello.com to create user stories and set story velocities. 
As I make progress I submit my code to my remote GitHub repository. Each time I send a commit to GitHub 
my project is in working order.

During the course of this project, I am committed to diving deeper into code documentation via APIs, 
refactoring my code to maintain good O.O. Principles, and intentionally writing clean readable code.

Purpose:

I am writing this program to explore these languages, gain experience, and expand my abilities.
