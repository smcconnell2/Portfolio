                I am a Software Engineer and currently I work as the Web Specialist at Union Gospel Mission in Spokane
                WA. I recieved a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Eastern Washington University. My core
                language is Java, and I actively
                use JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, JavaFX, FXML, and have experiance in JavaScript frameworks like Tabris. I
                have also been successful using many other languages including C, C++, SQL, PHP, and Python.

                I've been
                married for eight years and have four children. I am a diverse
                person, with interests in computer programing, art, woodworking, and the outdoors. I entered the field
                of computer science with no previous background and worked hard to gain the skills I now have. Computer
                programming has become a passion. I am proud of my accomplishments and excited to be applying my
                skills in professional settings.
