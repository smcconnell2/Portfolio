                        <p>
                            This application allows the user to create budgets via a user interface. During
                            budget
                            creation,
                            the user goes through multiple pages prompting for information like income and expenses.
                            Expenses
                            consist of different information including priority, that is set using drag and drop.
                            All
                            entered
                            information is displayed through list views and individual month and expense cells are
                            editable.
                            <br><br>
                            I am creating this application using JavaFX, Java, FXML, and CSS. I am heavily using the
                            MVC
                            design
                            pattern for user interface aspects of this project. Java and JavaFX are used for the
                            controller
                            and
                            model while FXML and CSS are being used for the view. The Observer pattern is used for
                            changes
                            made
                            to different aspects of the overall budget. The Factory pattern is used to create
                            different
                            display
                            cells, like expenses and months.

                        <h3>Process:</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started this project with knowledge I learned from taking a GUI class at EWU. During the
                            early stages I took a course on LinkedIn Learning to get a better understanding of JavaFX.
                            While coding this application I regularly reference Oracle's JavaFX and Java API.
                            <br><br>

                            I am practicing Agile principles by using Trello.com to create user stories and set
                            story
                            velocities.
                            As I make progress I submit my code to my remote GitHub repository. Each time I send a
                            commit to
                            GitHub
                            my project is in working order.

                            During the course of this project, I am committed to diving deeper into code
                            documentation
                            via
                            APIs,
                            refactoring my code to maintain good O.O. Principles, and intentionally writing clean
                            readable
                            code.

                            I added complexity and visuals, using CSS and JavaScript. I reference MDN web docs often for
                            API documentation.

                        <ul>
                            <li>I created a maze map that dynamically changed as the player interacted with it and
                                changed
                                the map using String manipulation and logic.</li>
                            <li>I wrote the maze object where the maze is created as a 2D matrix and while the
                                player
                                traverses the maze I
                                used dynamic programing to recursively check if the end of the maze was still
                                reachable.
                            </li>
                            <li>I was successful as team lead. I ensured we met for meetings, set reachable tasks,
                                and
                                completed our project on time.</li>

                        <p>
                            The player enters a trivia maze hosted by a devious maze master
                            who secretly wishes you ill will. Go through doors by answering
                            movie trivia and try to make it to the bottom right room to win.
                            If you answer a question incorrectly that door is locked to you
                            for the remainder of the game. Block yourself from reaching the
                            end and you lose.
