ABOUT: 
I made this website because my wife and her brother started a dinner
club where they meet once a week and plan a new interesting dinner to be
intentional about good food and quality family time.

TECHNOLOGIES:
* Hosted through siteground.com
* Visual Studio Code 
* XAMPP-Control
* MySQL

LANGUAGES:
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* PHP

STAGE:
* This is a work in progress. 
* Tabs are functional and each page or overlay is functional.
* Database stores and retrieves information (adding and deleting entries works)
* Contacts tab works to send emails
* Calendar is in working condition (adding events locally and veiwing calendar)
* Page scales appropriately

IN PROGRESS:
* Calendar stores events locally and cannot be accessed from another computer
* Formatting of recipe entry needs work for readability
* Ability to upload images for recipes
* When adding to or deleting from Recipes user is brought to another page
* Editting current database entry is not working (although deleting entry works)
