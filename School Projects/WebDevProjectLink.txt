ABOUT:
Project I completed while taking Web Application Developement (CSCD378) called Essentials of Life

Assignment was to access Google Maps via google's api and allow user to choose a location
with a radius from the location. Then display longitude and latitude and provide buttons representing
"essentails of life". The essentials include gas stations, restrooms, beverages, food, etc.
Each button then populates the map with markers idicating location of specified essential. 

I went above assignment expectations by implementing button images, a gif, background image,
map indicator animation, and general CSS additions to improve visaul appearance. 

STATUS: Complete
