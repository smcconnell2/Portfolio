Final shell project for Operating Systems.

I was tasked to complete problems 1,2,4,6,7, and 8. I recieved 100% on the assignment.

Problems 1,2,4,6,7,8 All work correctly with no memory leaks.

The program is very space dependent. For example "ls | wc" functions properly, but "ls |wc" doesn't. 

Project specifications are located in lab7.pdf.
